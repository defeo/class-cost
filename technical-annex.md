# TECHNICAL ANNEX

## 1	S&T EXCELLENCE

### 1.1	Soundness of the Challenge 

TODO: Ben

#### 1.1.1	DESCRIPTION OF THE STATE-OF-THE-ART
#### 1.1.2	DESCRIPTION OF THE CHALLENGE (MAIN AIM)


### 1.2	Progress beyond the state-of-the-art 

TODO: Chloe (Chloe: I'll work on this properly after Ben has written the state-of-the-art so that things are somewhat unified)

#### 1.2.1	APPROACH TO THE CHALLENGE AND PROGRESS BEYOND THE STATE-OF-THE-ART

To include:
-Book from summer school
-Cryptanalysis workshop(s)? + focussed workshop
-Development of new protocols by dedicated WG on number-theoretic foundations
-Implementation dedicated WG and focussed workshop(s)
-Database focussed workshop (follow-up from implementation or combined?)
-STSMs (e.g. to foster research connections formed at workshops??)

#### 1.2.2	Objectives

**TODO**

##### 1.2.2.1 Research Coordination Objectives

- Developing the field of isogeny-based cryptography both by improving the understanding of the existing protocols and by developing new protocols.
- Leading the development of a common understanding internationally of both classical and quantum algorithms applied to isogeny-based cryptosystems.
- Create an open-source database of isogeny formulas. This naturally complements and can be included in the already widely-used Explicit Formulas Database (https://hyperelliptic.org/EFD/). **TODO** check with Tanja.
- Write a book on isogeny-based cryptography covering the basic topics needed for a newcomer to the topic to start doing research in the area.
- Disseminate the work acheived through COST collaborations by presenting at high-profile international cryptography conferences such as Eurocrypt.
- Input to international standards on post-quantum cryptography such as the ongoing competition being led by NIST.


What we discussed:
- Dissemination
- Development of common understanding
- Input to marketers
- Input to stakeholders (e.g., NIST)?
- Data curation?

##### 1.2.2.2 Capacity-building Objectives

- Growing the field of isogeny-based cryptography by fostering existing research connections. As this is an emerging field, no one country has a critical mass of isogeny-based cryptography reseachers. Most of the innovative papers (about 1 per year) resulted from multinational collaboration, and a research network will allow for a rapid increase in research output.
- Bringing together reseachers from cryptography, number theory, and quantum computing, all of whom have relevant and different perspectives on the major open problems in isogeny-based cryptography.
- Allowing Early Career Investigators who would otheriwse be isolated or limited to very few local collaborators to connect with the whole European isogeny-based cryptography community.
- Promoting and supporting female and non-binary researchers in the field, both by a having a diverse consortium with respect to gender (at each level of involvement), and by collaboration with the Women in Numbers Europe community.

What we discussed:
- Bridging fields
- Building new stuff
